The implemented algorithm does a good job for exact graph matching. However, it can also be used for subgraph isomorphism. Overall, the algorithm is efficient for practical usage, where it exploits the graph's characteristics. Future work can include making the interfaces to work on generic data structures, and extending it to subgraph isomorphism.  

Working on this project was a very good insight to the design automation field and also gave a good knowledge of working with graphs and understanding the system as a whole. Node merging and exact graph matching were successfully achieved in this project. The Graphical Modeling Project can now be carried forward to have a very good graphical editor.
