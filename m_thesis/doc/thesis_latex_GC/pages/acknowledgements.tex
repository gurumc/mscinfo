%TODO: Acknowledgments

Writing this master's thesis would not have been possible without the help of these people. 
First, I would like to thank my advisors Daniel Krefft and Sebastian Eckl, who immediately accepted my request to do the thesis at the chair and guided me to select the research topic. Special thanks to Daniel Krefft for his continuous support and brilliant advice throughout the thesis phases.

%which he has given me every time we had a discussion.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.Baumgarten for allowing me to do my research and for providing all the facilities at the Chair. 

Thanks to Paul Nieleck, who worked on his master thesis at the department, for his excellent collaboration and sharing his knowledge on the project. I would also like to thank Alexander Reisner for sharing his invaluable experience on the project. 

Thank you to my family and friends for providing me the required freedom and support.
